This project debuted in september 2021 for our third year in engineering, it was a team project (**PING**, **P**rojet d'**I**ngénieur **N**umérique **G**énéraliste in french) from 4 to 5 members and we had the opportunity to make a project on any subject. The purpose was to learn to build a business plan, lean canvas and finally gain skills.

We decided to create **a mobile application** to make it available everywhere and also to track students consumptions and expenses according to their goals before or after eating it.
\
Our team was composed of 5 members, 3 (including me) from a 2 year degree of computer science and 2 other from prepatory classes. Therefore we were a diverse team.
