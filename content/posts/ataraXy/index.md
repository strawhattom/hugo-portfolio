This post is still in building !

## Context
This project was made during my intership for the end of my computer science degree at **Universit√© Sorbonne Paris Nord** (Villetaneuse, France). The aim was to create a mobile app where students could use it to answer prepared quiz by an organizer (most likely a teacher).
\
The management of these quizzes were also have to be made, since the client was my supervisor, i had to create totally a new page on his website (in **PHP**).
